# AirBnB Clone

A complete Web Application consisting of:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)


## The Console

- create your data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## Files and Directories

- models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
- tests directory will contain all unit tests.
- console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
- models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It - contains common elements:
    - attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
    - methods: save() and to_json()
- models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
